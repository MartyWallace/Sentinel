# Sentinel

A modern ActionScript 3 game framework built on Starling and Box2D.

### Website

I plan to add documentation and a tutorial at [the website](http://sentinel.martywallace.com) once I have a properly tested, stable release. In the meantime, the [tests](https://github.com/MartyWallace/Sentinel/tree/master/tests/MartyWallace) should give you a good idea of how to go about setting up a game.
